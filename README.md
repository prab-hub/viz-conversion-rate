# viz-conversion-rate
The dataset we'll use describes Euro daily exchange rates between 1999 and 2021. The euro (symbolized with â‚¬) is the official currency in most of the countries of the European Union.

Though this project is about trend of conversion rate between currencies, this can be easily replicated to analyze sales trend in business and market.
